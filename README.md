# ML Predictive Revenue Model

This project explores how advertising expense allocation impacts revenue by leveraging single and multivariate linear regression models. The goal is to predict sales based on advertising expenditures across TV, radio, and newspaper channels, and to identify the most influential features for prediction. This project highlights the importance of feature selection and multivariate analysis in predictive modeling. It demonstrates how data-driven decisions can optimize advertising budgets for maximum revenue impact.

# Models Developed:

**Simple Linear Regression:** Predicts sales using a single feature (e.g., TV, radio, or newspaper).
Demonstrates the impact of individual advertising channels on sales.

**Multivariate Linear Regression:** Combines multiple features (e.g., TV and radio) to predict sales.
Focuses on the features with the highest correlation coefficients to improve prediction accuracy.

# Key findings:

**Correlation Analysis:** TV advertising has the highest correlation with sales, with a correlation coefficient of 0.90, making it the most significant single predictor.

# Model Performance:

**Simple Linear Regression:** Achieved an R² of 0.78, showing strong predictive power when using TV as the sole feature.

**Multivariate Linear Regression:** Improved overall prediction accuracy with an R² of 0.87, leveraging the combined influence of the top correlated features.
